# Migration Guide for J2EE Web Applications that use SAP Java Buildpack for securing their applications


**This document is only applicable for J2EE web applications securing their application with SAP Java Buildpack.** The SAP Java Buildpack version `1.26.1` does not any longer provide deprecated SAP-internal security libraries and does not longer depend on Spring security. 

This migration document is a step-by-step guide explaining how to replace your dependencies to the deprecated SAP-internal security libraries with the open-sourced ones.

## Prerequisites

Please note, this Migration Guide is only intended for applications using SAP Java Buildpack. You're using the SAP Java Buildpack if you can find the `sap_java_buildpack` in the deployment descriptor of your application, e.g. in your `manifest.yml` file.

## Cleanup Maven Dependencies <a name="maven"></a>

First check the `pom.xml` of your application for dependencies to the deprecated sap-internal security api projects:

groupId (deprecated) | artifactId (deprecated) 
--- | --- 
com.sap.xs2.security | java-container-security-api 
com.sap.cloud.security.xssec | api 
com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa | java-container-security-api 

**If you do not have any of the api projects above as dependency you can skip this guide!**

The above mentioned dependencies should be removed / replaced with this one:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa</groupId>
    <artifactId>api</artifactId>
    <version>2.7.3</version>
    <scope>provided</scope> <!-- provided with buildpack -->
</dependency>
```

Furthermore, make sure that you do not refer to any other SAP-internal security library with group-id `com.sap.security` or `com.sap.security.nw.sso.*`. 

### SAP_JWT_TRUST_ACL obsolete
There is no need to configure `SAP_JWT_TRUST_ACL` within your deployment descriptor such as `manifest.yml`. 
Instead the Xsuaa service instance adds audiences to the issued JSON Web Token (JWT) as part of the `aud` claim.

Whether the token is issued for your application or not is now validated by the [`JwtAudienceValidator`](/java-security/src/main/java/com/sap/cloud/security/token/validation/validators/JwtAudienceValidator.java).


### Congratulation! With that you're Done!

### Troubleshooting

If you get stuck with migrating your application you can follow the steps described in this section
to troubleshoot the issue. 

#### Check buildpack version

To identify the root cause of your issue it is helpful to know which version of the 
SAP Java Buildpack your application is using. 
The buildpack being used is defined in the `manifest.yml` file via the
[buildpacks](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest-attributes.html#buildpack) option.
If it is set to `sap_java_buildpack` then the **newest** available version of the SAP Java buildpack is used.
The command `cf buildpacks` gives you a list of buildpacks available in your environment.
With this you can find out which version of the buildpack your application is actually using.

Lets say in your `manifest.yml` the buildpack is set to `sap_java_buildpack`. This means the newest
available version is being used! Now you check the available buildpacks with `cf buildpacks`
which will give you something like  this:

```sh
Getting buildpacks...

buildpack                       position   enabled   locked   filename                                             stack
staticfile_buildpack            1          true      false    staticfile_buildpack-cached-cflinuxfs3-v1.5.5.zip    cflinuxfs3
java_buildpack                  2          true      false    java_buildpack-cached-cflinuxfs3-v4.31.1.zip         cflinuxfs3
.
.
.
sap_java_buildpack              12         true      false    sap_java_buildpack-v1.26.1.zip
sap_java_buildpack_1_26         13         true      false    sap_java_buildpack-v1.26.1.zip
sap_java_buildpack_1_25         14         true      false    sap_java_buildpack-v1.25.0.zip
sap_java_buildpack_1_24         15         true      false    sap_java_buildpack-v1.24.1.zip
```

Here you can see that the newest SAP Java Buildpack is `sap_java_buildpack_1_26` and therefore your application
is using the SAP Java Buildpack version `1.26.x`!

#### Increase log level 

You should also increase the logging level in your application. This can be done by setting the `SET_LOGGING_LEVEL`
environment variable for your application. You can do this in the `manifest.yml` with the `env` option like so:

```yaml
env:
    SET_LOGGING_LEVEL: '{com.sap.xs.security: DEBUG, com.sap.cloud.security: DEBUG}'
```

After you have made changes to the `manifest.yml` you need do re-deploy your app.
This sets the logging level for this library and the security parts of the buildpack to `DEBUG`.

For a running application this can also be done with the `cf` command line tool:

```shell
cf set-env <your app name> SET_LOGGING_LEVEL "{com.sap.xs.security: DEBUG, com.sap.cloud.security: DEBUG}"
```

You need to restage your application for the changes to take effect.

#### Open an issue
If you are still stuck with migration, please
[open an issue on Github](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration/issues/new)
and provide details like client-lib / migration guide / buildpack version / issue youâ€™re facing and, when available, (debug) logs.

### [OPTIONAL] Leverage new API and features
You can continue [here](Migration_SAPJavaBuildpackProjects_V2.md) to understand what needs to be done to leverage the new `java-api` that is exposed by the SAP Java Buildpack as of version `1.26.1`.
