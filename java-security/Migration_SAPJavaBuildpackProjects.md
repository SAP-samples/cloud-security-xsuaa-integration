# Migration Guide for J2EE Web Applications that use SAP Java Buildpack for securing their applications


**This document is only applicable for J2EE web applications securing their application with SAP Java Buildpack.** The SAP Java Buildpack version `1.26.1` does not any longer provide deprecated SAP-internal security libraries and does not longer depend on Spring security. 

This migration document is a step-by-step guide explaining how to replace your dependencies to the deprecated SAP-internal security libraries with the open-sourced ones.

## Prerequisites

Please note, this Migration Guide is only intended for applications using SAP Java Buildpack. You're using the SAP Java Buildpack if you can find the `sap_java_buildpack` in the deployment descriptor of your application, e.g. in your `manifest.yml` file.

## Cleanup Maven Dependencies <a name="maven"></a>

First check the `pom.xml` of your application for dependencies to the deprecated sap-internal security api projects:

groupId (deprecated) | artifactId (deprecated) 
--- | --- 
com.sap.xs2.security | java-container-security-api 
com.sap.cloud.security.xssec | api 
com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa | java-container-security-api 

**If you do not have any of the api projects above as dependency you can skip this guide!**

The above mentioned dependencies should be removed / replaced with this one:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa</groupId>
    <artifactId>api</artifactId>
    <version>2.7.3</version>
    <scope>provided</scope> <!-- provided with buildpack -->
</dependency>
```

Furthermore, make sure that you do not refer to any other SAP-internal security library with group-id `com.sap.security` or `com.sap.security.nw.sso.*`. 

### SAP_JWT_TRUST_ACL obsolete
There is no need to configure `SAP_JWT_TRUST_ACL` within your deployment descriptor such as `manifest.yml`. 
Instead the Xsuaa service instance adds audiences to the issued JSON Web Token (JWT) as part of the `aud` claim.

Whether the token is issued for your application or not is now validated by the [`JwtAudienceValidator`](/java-security/src/main/java/com/sap/cloud/security/token/validation/validators/JwtAudienceValidator.java).


### Congratulation! With that you're Done!

### Troubleshooting

If you run into issues with the migration of your application, you can increase the logging level. 
This helps to identify the root cause of the issue. In the buildpack this can be done by setting the `SET_LOGGING_LEVEL`
environment variable for your application. You can do this in the `manifest.yml` with the `env` option like so:

```yaml
env:
    SET_LOGGING_LEVEL: '{com.sap.xs.security: DEBUG, com.sap.cloud.security: DEBUG}'
```
After you have made changes to the `manifest.yml` you need do re-deploy your app.
This sets the logging level for this library and the security parts of the buildpack to `DEBUG`.
For a running application this can also be done with the `cf` command line tool:

```shell
cf set-env <your app name> SET_LOGGING_LEVEL "{com.sap.xs.security: DEBUG, com.sap.cloud.security: DEBUG}"
```

You need to restage your application for the changes to take effect.

If you are still stuck with migration, please
[open an issue on Github](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration/issues/new)
and provide details like client-lib / migration guide / issue youâ€™re facing and, when available, (debug) logs.

### [OPTIONAL] Leverage new API and features
You can continue [here](Migration_SAPJavaBuildpackProjects_V2.md) to understand what needs to be done to leverage the new `java-api` that is exposed by the SAP Java Buildpack as of version `1.26.1`.
